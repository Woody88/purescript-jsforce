{-- Type Related Issue 
  we the function below there is an assumption that assumption that JSForce provides valid data of type `sobject`.
  And since itâ€™s on the FFI boundary the compiler will trust you.
  Based on Robert this is often referred as the `TypeScript Problem` :)

  With generics, you replace the assumed type on the FFI declaration with `Foreign` and decode it in PureScript, giving it all the guarantees you would have if you had declared the data in PS (edited)
  Generics adds compile-time static type reflection and typeclass-based code generation.

  libraries needed `foreign-generic` + `generics-rep`
